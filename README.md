This is a technological invention on  social media platform that result in making of an application that is  interactive ,reliable  and powerful than any other social media application platform in the word ,I come up with this idea  after I did some research by observing the dominant social media software's in the world , in references on what they contain and how they serve their customers,,my hypothesis nulls this findings since what is going to be contained in this application will be modulated  with more personality things that someone don't expect to find them and easily access them when they need them and partly public  profiles like knowing people across the world.

The users of this application will be satisfied with what they  can  access they will  be concerned with their personal life's .Where it carries all the module of life like family , finances, documents and secrets of someone , accessing this can only be acceded by using a key that is encrypted, the key will have to a span of 3 attempts if more it will log off the system for 2hrs, for security reasons. The properties of this key is that it cannot be known by a third party ..only involves the machine and the person ...The reason for a third party not getting involved in this is because to achieve confidentiality,integrity and availability ,that are core security issues.

The persons in servers cannot access this unless they know the crypt key the user is using , and that is confidential.

The users will have to store their personal life s in this application.

And at some extent view public status of other people who have decided to put their status public,also they will have their profile picture online with setting of who to view who. They will be notified about who viewed their profile picture online and comments on it .Chating will be necessary so that users can chat with their friends within their contact and extend if user allow public chats.

User can write short notes and store them also update his/CV..

More cooling and refreshing times will be included in the application where user will have to listen to music or watch video depending on his/her choice..
